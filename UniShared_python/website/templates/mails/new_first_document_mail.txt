Did you notice that you can invite your friends in seconds to take notes together in real-time with the “Invite” button on the top right corner?

It enables you to:

* Get better notes. Why the hell are we all taking them solo?
* Make your classes/conferences funnier by interacting with people, be they physically with you or not
* Participate in spreading knowledge by sharing what your learning

Prepare your next session by starting your document ({{BASE_URL}}{% url website.views.create_document %}?{{ ga_campaign_params }}) now and scheduling it for your next class session.
